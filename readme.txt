<dropdown placeholder="Select driver/ Pair vehicle" items="items" selected="item" objects="objectList"
              property="propertyList"></dropdown>


1. placeholder is the default one to show in the select box.
2. 'items'- it is the the whole object containg all the data.
3. objectList is an array containing two keys i.e. 'driver' and 'vehicle' .
4. propertyList is an araay of properties which we want to show.
5. selected is the value with initialized value from parent controller
	and when an item is selected then you can check the console for new data of selected value
	which shows how the data is two way bound between parent controller and custome directive.
